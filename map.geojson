    "description":"\"This folio is a depiction of the great Persian hero Rustam’s confrontation with the div chief Arzhang during the seven labours that he and his horse Raksh undergo on their mission to rescue the Shah Kai Kaus and his retainers. Rustam undertook this monumental quest when Shah Kai Kaus was manipulated into invading the dangerous land of Mazandaran, occupied by the div, evil creatures led by the White Div and Arzhang. Failing in his attempt to conquer Mazandaran, the Shah and his men are captured by the White Div and blinded. Upon hearing this, Rustam rushes off atop Raksh to save the Shah and his men. Rustam’s slaying of the div chief Arzhang is his sixth and penultimate labour on this journey, where Rustam, approaching Arzhang mounted on his horse Raksh “grasped boldly his head and ears and neck, then lion-like tore off his head and flung it at his troops” (Ferdowsi 1908, 57). After slaying Arzhang, the other div who followed the chief scatter in fear, as Rustam pursues them sword in hand (Ferdowsi 1908, 57). During the remainder of Firdawsi’s account of the sixth labour, Rustam and Raksh untie their untrustworthy guide Ulad who leads them in secret to where Kai Kaus and his men are kept, proclaiming to them all his intention to slay the White Div in his cave and to restore the sight of the Shah and his retainers (Ferdowsi 1908, 58-59).\" (Hebert & Dempsey)"},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
