    "description":"\"This folio is a depiction of the great Persian hero Rustam’s confrontation with the div chief Arzhang during the seven labours that he and his horse Raksh undergo on their mission to rescue the Shah Kai Kaus and his retainers. Rustam undertook this monumental quest when Shah Kai Kaus was manipulated into invading the dangerous land of Mazandaran, occupied by the div, evil creatures led by the White Div and Arzhang. Failing in his attempt to conquer Mazandaran, the Shah and his men are captured by the White Div and blinded. Upon hearing this, Rustam rushes off atop Raksh to save the Shah and his men. Rustam’s slaying of the div chief Arzhang is his sixth and penultimate labour on this journey, where Rustam, approaching Arzhang mounted on his horse Raksh “grasped boldly his head and ears and neck, then lion-like tore off his head and flung it at his troops” (Ferdowsi 1908, 57). After slaying Arzhang, the other div who followed the chief scatter in fear, as Rustam pursues them sword in hand (Ferdowsi 1908, 57). During the remainder of Firdawsi’s account of the sixth labour, Rustam and Raksh untie their untrustworthy guide Ulad who leads them in secret to where Kai Kaus and his men are kept, proclaiming to them all his intention to slay the White Div in his cave and to restore the sight of the Shah and his retainers (Ferdowsi 1908, 58-59).\" (Hebert & Dempsey)"},

    "description":"\"The position of the figures within this image, Rustam mounted atop Raksh and Arzhang flailing beneath them in Rustam’s arms, coveys the might of the mounted warrior and establishes the power dynamic within the story. The image captures Rustam at a moment in the story where he has already beaten Arzhang, holding the div’s horns in his hands as the div flails desperately to escape, thus conveying Rustam’s might as a warrior by effectively depicting the swiftness of his victory over a foe second in fierceness to the White Div. While Arzhang facial expression is one of pain and terror, his body is limp as he is dragged along beside Raksh, his legs unable to muster the strength and only one of his arms raised to meet Rustam’s, which drapes ineffectually over the hero’s gauntlet, thus conveying his inability to resist Rustam’s attack.\""},

    "description":"\"Rustam’s martial prowess is conveyed further in his dress. Rustam’s headgear is the most striking part of his dress, he wears the head of a leopard under a helmet as indicated by what appears to be a mail guard protecting the sides of his head and neck. Another piece of armour on full display are the gauntlets on Rustam’s arms, coloured in gold. He wears a leopard’s skin atop a green tunic over his torso. The depiction of Rustam as a warrior figure is illustrated through his attire, tying together several crucial aspects of his character within Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh. Rustam’s leopard skin is significant as it showcases his strength by alluding to his domination over nature, while also tying into his heroic heritage being the son of Zal and a descendant of Gayumars, the first king of Persia who is often depicted as being draped with a leopard pelt to convey both his power and his connection to the natural world. The colour palate of Rustam’s other attire is also notable, firstly, his green tunic is an interesting choice as green holds strong significance with Islam, tying the pre-Islamic hero to contemporary religious iconography. Additionally, Rustam’s armour has a golden colouration, with gold being such a valuable and prestigious metal, this choice further illustrates his noble heritage and his prestige within society.\""},

    "description":"\"In contrast to Rustam’s status and heritage being conveyed through his attire, Arzhang’s attire and facial expressions indicate his wild and deranged state. Firstly, Arzhang’s clothing is significant in his lack of coverage, wearing only a red kilt and a yellow belt. The div chief’s clothes signify his detachment from Persian society through his immodesty, exposing his full torso down to his waist. Within Islam, modesty in one’s dress is exceedingly important, and considering the intended audience of this illustration, the choice to depict Arzhang immodestly builds upon his wild and antagonistic character. Another important aspect of Arzhang’s depiction is his animalistic features, spouting brown fur across his body, a tail, horns, large ears, and a long snout, highlighting the hybridization of human and animal within the div, indicating their supernatural status and their difference from both Rustam and his horse Raksh. Arzhang’s facial expression is one of desperation, with his mouth open and his eyes wide showcasing a loss of control and a sense of panic, again illustrating the div’s lack of refinement and savage nature.\""},

    "description":"\"The Shahnameh is widely recognized as one of the most important works of historical Persian literature, serving as an important means through which pre-Islamic cultural forms and notions of kingship were interwoven with Islam to promote a separate Persian identity within the Muslim world in an era where global Arabic, Turkic, and Mongolian dynasties vied for control over traditional Persian lands. However, the Shahnameh would often change and evolve with the tides of history as new artistic styles and interpretations were introduced. One of the most notable ways that stories like the Shahnameh changed over time was in the ways its words were rewritten by later authors to support new ideological realities. A notable example of this can be found in the development of Firdawsi’s Rustam and the contrast with his reimagining in the later Asadi Shahnameh. The historic origins of Rustam’s story are nebulous, possibly combining Scythian legends and the Zoroastrian hero Kresaspa, being integrated into Persian culture during the pre-Islamic Sassanid era, though Rustam was characterized as a brutish figure during this period (Ghaemi and Ghandeharion 2019, 245). As Firdawsi collected stories for his Shahnameh, he rehabilitated Rustam’s image somewhat, keeping his unruly warrior nature while integrating him within the new monotheistic regime as a positive figure (Ghaemi and Ghandeharion 2019, 246). However, in Asadi’s Shahnameh, Rustam is characterized as a wandering philosopher whose true strength is his wisdom (Ghaemi and Ghandeharion 2019, 249), embodying the core aspects of Shia Islam weaving direct Islamic philosophy and Sufi mysticism into a pre-established national myth (Ghaemi and Ghandeharion 2019, 249, 253). While this image depicts Firdawsi’s warrior Rustam, the character himself is not a monolith, taking on the shape that authors and artists prescribe him, using him as a vehicle to promote Persian identity as Firdawsi does, or as a vehicle to tie Persian identity to Shia Islam as Asadi does.\""},

    "description":"\"Upon viewing this folio, one might be quick to notice the fine calligraphy covering half of the page, with the story of Rustam’s sixth labour in fine Persian calligraphy, though one should note that the script used in this manuscript is a Persian localization of Arabic script. Calligraphy was an important aspect of any illustrated manuscript within the Muslim tradition, and a good calligrapher could expect to find great fame and fortune, often surpassing that of contemporary painters (Bahari 2014, 158). Calligraphers were highly specialized craftsmen and could be considered crucial resources for rulers looking to legitimize their rule through great works such as fine manuscripts, such as emperor Akbar’s attempts to draw upon the splendor of the Timurid dynasty and its artistic tradition to legitimize and valorize his own Mughal empire (Mellville 2021, 204-205). The stylistic elements of the written words on the page speak to the high regard calligraphy was held in by the Timurids, with borders around the text framing an orderly and purposeful display of knowledge, with the centerpiece of the text area, a box of golden calligraphy decorated with depictions of flowers and other flora, showcasing the synergy between the written word and illustrations that define the illustrated manuscript as an art form. Lastly, the calligraphy acts as a reminder of the great linkages that connect the Islamic world across time and space, wherein an Arabic script is used to describe images of Persian folklore, examples of which would go on to influence the style and prestige of Mughal emperors in India, thus illustrating that texts such as the Bodleian manuscript are more than just products of their time, but the cumulative product of centuries of cross-cultural contact.\""},

    "description":"\"Another important piece within the image that assists us in understanding the global context of this or any manuscript illustration is the background imagery present, as the influence of different schools of painting can be found within many illustrated manuscripts from across the Islamic world. Artists would draw on traditional Persian and Arabic styles at times, sometimes incorporating elements of Chinese art introduced by trade and Mongol conquest, with some late examples of illustrated manuscripts incorporating European styles and techniques during the Qajar period, thus characterizing the art of many illustrated manuscripts as conversations between the past and present (Assemi 2022, 276). Pictured above is an example of this interplay between art styles from the Safavid period, wherein stylistic elements of Chinese landscape painting can be seen in its highly detailed depictions of lush vegetation and sharp, colourful mountains working together to lend the piece a sense of intense verticality. Meanwhile, our scene of Rustam’s sixth labour takes place on a relatively flat landscape devoid of much detail, resembling a white hill with small blue depictions of vegetation against a golden sky. This depiction shifts focus towards the figures in the image drawing the eye to the conflict between Rustam and Arzhang rather than using the background as a space to showcase artistic development as other manuscripts influenced by Chinese and European landscape paintings would, indicating a focus on retaining a focus on traditionally Persian art forms, which traditionally maintained a ‘stage-like’ composition (Assemi 2022, 279).\""},
